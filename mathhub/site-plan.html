      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page is where the user will spend very little of their time as it is simply an introduction to the site.
        Through the home page, the user will be able to access the subpages easily and give them an introduction to the site.
        The home page will have a hero image as well as other images under it that help explain the purpose of the website.
        The images under it, with the AMC and MathCounts logos will take the user directly to the AMC and MathCounts pages repectively.
        The home page will also have explanations of the AMC and MathCounts tests.
        The purpose of keeping these descriptions on the home page is to allow the subpages to be cluttered as little as possible.
        Under these, there may be quotes from students who use the website to prepare for their own competitions.
        The home page will allow people to see the purpose of the site quickly and easily.
        The home page will have a traditional setup to a normal home page.
        The navigation will be at the top, followed by a hero image and title, and then having the main content of the homepage before the footer.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img src="images/maa.png" alt="image for homepage">
        <img src="images/mathcounts.jpeg" alt="image for homepage">

      </ul>
      <h3>AMC</h3>
      <p>
        The AMC subpage will be where the hub is for all of the past AMC 8, 10, and 12 tests.
        The page will be set out in a way to attempt to help the user get where they want to go quickly and easily.
        The top of the page will be dedicated to recent tests, followed by tests getting older down toward the bottom.
        The purpose of this alignment is to keep recent tests, which are better to practice on when preparing for the tests, toward the top and more likely to be clicked on.
        When a test is clicked, the link will take the user directly to a copy of the test.
        The images for this page will be at the very top and at the bottom.
        Descriptions will be at the bottom to keep the top of the page from cluttering but still allow descriptions someone on the subpage.
        This page will keep the consistency of having the navigation at the top, content in the middle, and footer at the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>Images for AMC</p>
        <img src="images/maa.png" alt="image for AMC">

      </ul>
      <h3>MathCounts</h3>
      <p>
        The MathCounts subpage will be where the hub is for al of the past MathCounts tests.
        The page will be layed out similarly to the AMC page, but will be slightly simpler because of only one type of test throughout the whole page.
        The page will also start with the most recent tests first, before dropping down to the older tests by the end.
        When a test is clicked, the link will take the user directly to a copy of the test.
        The images will be layed out the same way to provide similarity between pages on the site.
        Descriptions will be at the bottom to keep the top of the page from cluttering but still allow descriptions someone on the subpage.
        This page will keep the consistency of having the navigation at the top, content in the middle, and footer at the bottom.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        (The two pieces of text directly under the images are links to the subpages.)

      <h3>AMC</h3>
      <p>         
        The left side of the page is all the links while to the right of it is a description of the tests.

      <img src="images/subpage-wireframe.png" alt="AMC wireframe">

      <h3>MathCounts</h3>
      <p>         
        This has the same layout as the AMC subpage but will have different text.
